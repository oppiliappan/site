            <p><a href="https://v2.onivim.io">Onivim</a> is a &#8216;modern modal editor&#8217;, combining fancy
interface and language features with vim-style modal editing. What&#8217;s wrong you
ask?</p>

<p>Apart from <a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni2/issues/550">buggy syntax highlighting</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni2/issues/519">broken scrolling</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22daily+editor+blocker%22+is%3Aopen">others</a>,
Onivim is <strong>proprietary</strong> software. It is licensed under a commercial 
<a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni1/blob/master/Outrun-Labs-EULA-v1.1.md">end user agreement license</a>,
which prohibits redistribution in both object code and source code formats.</p>

<p>Onivim&#8217;s core editor logic (bits that belong to vim), have been separated from
the interface, into <a href="https://github.com/onivim/libvim">libvim</a>. libvim is
licensed under MIT, which means, this &#8216;extension&#8217; of vim is perfectly in
adherence to <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html#license">vim&#8217;s license text</a>! 
Outrun Labs are exploiting this loophole (distributing vim as a library) to
commercialize Onivim.</p>

<p>Onivim&#8217;s source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni2">GitHub</a>.
They do mention that the source code trickles down to the
<a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni2-mit">oni2-mit</a> repository, which (not yet) contains
MIT-licensed code, <strong>18 months</strong> after each commit to the original repository.</p>

<p>Want to contribute to Onivim? Don&#8217;t. They make a profit out of your contributions.
Currently, Onivim is priced at $19.99, &#8216;pre-alpha&#8217; pricing which is 80% off the
final price! If you are on the lookout for an editor, I would suggest using
<a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a>, charity ware that actually works, and costs $100 lesser.</p>
